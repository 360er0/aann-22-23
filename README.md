## Grading
The grading is based on the final project related to training a deep learning model.

#### Requirements:
- The topic of the project is up to you. You can choose anything that interests you. If you don't have an idea for a project you can participate in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions?listOption=active&hostSegmentIdFilter=1) or [PolEval](https://beta.poleval.pl/) competitions.
- The major part of the project should be the fine-tuning of a deep learning model.
- The project should be described in a short paper (~2 pages) which contains: the description of the task, the datasets you used, the process of creating the model, and the results.
- You can make the project alone or in pairs. If you make a project in pairs the scope of the project should be larger.

#### Important dates:
- **04.12.2022** - Send me an email with the project proposal. Even one sentence will suffice, e.g. "A classifier to recognize if it is raining outside based on a photo". 
- **~~29.01.2023~~ 10.02.2023**  - Send me an email with your final project, i.e. a short paper and the code you used to train the model.

#### Grading:
- The most important part is the process of creating the model. This includes but is not limited to: choosing the appropriate evaluation method, choosing or preparing the datasets, and conducting experiments to train a model.
- The performance of the model itself won't be graded. However, you should make an effort to make it work and this will be graded.
- For a passing grade (3) you need to meet formal requirements, i.e. train a model and write a short paper about your project.
- For a good grade (4) you additionally should "deploy" your model. I recommend [Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces) which we will cover in the class. Taking part in a competition and submitting the solution also counts.
- For a very good grade (5) your process of creating a model must be well thought and justified in your short paper.

Feel free to write me an email if you have any questions or if you are stuck and need some advice.
